About Pathway :  
 
Pathway is a Palo Alto –based AI company building  LiveAI™ system s that process and adapt 
to data in real time, unifying batch and streaming workflows through a Python -native 
framework powered by a high -performance Rust engine. Founded around 2020 and backed 
by Łukasz Kaiser (co -creator of Transformers), Pathway is led by CEO Zuzanna Stamirowska, 
CTO Jan Chorowski, and CSO Adrian Koso wski. Its platform offers 300+ connectors, real -time 
retrieval -augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, and built -in vector/full -text search, 
enabling dynamic AI assistants, analytics, and document processing without separate vector 
databases. Trusted by orga nizations like NATO, Intel, DB Schenker, and Formula 1 teams, 
Pathway has been recognized as a leader in next -gen generative AI infrastructure . 
 
In this Hack For Green Bharat hackathon , you’ll build the projects using 
pathway framework . 
 
Pathway is recently known for inventing BDH Architecture – a post -transformer 
LLM architecture that enables generalization, real -time learning in LLMs, and 
interpretability (unlike other black -box LLMs).  
 
However, be mindful that your focus for this hackathon is on the Pathway 
framework. The Pathway framework, when used for RAG/Argentic use cases, 
maintains a live hybrid index that updates the instant a file changes. You can 
use it t o connect 300+ data sources, for pre -processing and post processing if 
bandwidth permits during the hackathon, for its MCP server, or simply for live 
vector and BM25 indexes that always stay up to date.

         Some Project ideas using pathway framework  
 
 
• Real -Time Document Q&A; (Live RAG)  
• Live News / Content Summarizer  
• Simulated Event Monitoring Dashboard  
• Real -Time Financial Spend Analyzer  
• Live Stock / Crypto Market Intelligence  
• Streaming Log Analysis & Anomaly Detection  
• Sm art Logistics & ETA Prediction System  
• Predictive Maintenance + Technician Assistant  
• Multi -Source Real -Time AI Agent  
 
Important Note  : This hackathon focuses on building real -time AI systems 
using Pathway. Projects must ingest live or simulated streams, proc ess them 
continuously, and update outputs automatically.  
 
One -line rule : If your system does not update automatically when new data 
arrives, it is not a Pathway project.

in
 
complex,

Among
 
critical
 
CV
 
tasks,
 
semantic
 
segment ation
 
plays
 
a
 
pivotal
 
role
 
in
 
obstacle
 
avoidance
 
by
 
providing
 
fine-grained
 
scene
 
understanding.
 
However,
 
training
 
high-per forming
 
segment ation
 
models
 
traditionall y
 
relies
 
on
 
supervised
 
learning,
 
which
 
requires
 
large,
 
labeled
 
datasets
 
for
 
effective

Attaining
 
this
 
data
 
in
 
the
 
real
 
world,
 
with
 
necessar y
 
volume
 
and
 
variety
 
for
 
successful
 
training,
 
is
 
generall y
 
costly
 
and
 
time-consuming,
 
and
 
often
 
still
 
proves
 
insufficient.
 
 
Synthetic
 
data
 
presents
 
a
 
promising
 
solution,
 
and
 
has
 
already
 
been
 
explored
 
as
 
a
 
means
 
to
 
address
 
data

Creating
 
the

costs
 
much
 
less

Hack For Green Bharat Hackathon Problem 
Statement   
1. Pathway Overview  
  
Pathway builds the first post -transformer frontier model that solves AI’s fundamental memory problem. 
While transformers wake up in the same state every time —like Groundhog Day —our architecture 
enables true continuous learning, infinite -context reasoning, and real -time adaptation. We’re not 
optimizing yesterday’s technology; we’re building what comes after transformers.  
A Python -based framework for real -time AI pipelines – it is designed to ingest data streams from more 
than 300 sources, process them on th e fly, and make the results queryable with large -language models  
(LLMs). It provides connectors for files, databases, message queues and enterprise services, 
automatically detects new records and updates, chunks and embeds documents, and maintains a live 
vector index.  
Unlike most retrieval -augmented generation (RAG) stacks that rely on external vector databases, 
Pathway’s Document Store keeps the vector index inside the pipeline. It combines semantic similarity 
search with BM15 full -text search to return relevant documents and is automatically synchronised with 
data sources. This live indexing avoids the need to re -ingest data in batches and allows generative 
models to answer queries using the latest information.  
Pathway’s streaming engine also supports b uilding microservices and complex data transforms, as 
demonstrated by La Poste’s postal -logistics microservices that process 16 million GPS points each year to 
predict truck arrival times and generate anomaly alerts; the project cut the operating cost of t he IoT 
                                                           
1 . Key Ideas Behind Real -Time AI and RAG  
• Real -Time vs Batch Processing  
Traditional batch systems process data periodically; this introduces delays and stale information. Real -
time streaming ingests, processes and outputs data within milliseconds, enabling decision -makers to 
react quickly and avoid outdated insights. Logistics , finance and manufacturing all require fast reaction to 
events; real -time streaming is therefore a competitive differentiator.

platform by 50% and reduced future capital expenditures. These features make Pathway suitable for 
industry -level applications where information is constantly changing and decisions must be made 
quickly.  
  
• Freshness of Indexes  
LLMs do not have an  inherent sense of time. To answer queries using up -to-date information, RAG 
systems must ensure their indexes stay synchronised with external data. Pathway’s Document Store 
continuously parses, chunks, embeds and indexes documents as they arrive and remov es deleted 
documents automatically. This is different from vector databases that must be re -ingested periodically or 
from architectures where retrieval logic is locked into the DB.  
• Event -Driven Architecture  
Modern AI agents require access to consistent , real -time data. Event -driven architectures (EDA), often 
powered by message brokers such as Apache Kafka and stream processors like Flink, provide exactly -
once semantics and scalable throughput; they are the backbone of agentic AI. Without high -integrity 
streaming data, autonomous agents may act on stale or inconsistent information.  
• Benefits of Data Streaming  
Continuous streaming allows businesses to react swiftly to changes, trends and anomalies, leading to 
better customer experiences, optimized opera tions and proactive issue resolution. Streaming also 
automates processes, reduces human error and supports cost -efficient operations.  
  
 
3. Use -Case Themes in IoT, Logistics and Manufacturing  
1. Real -Time Supply -Chain Visibility and ETA Predictions  
In transport and logistics, vehicles and containers emit streams of GPS coordinates, temperature and 
load -status signals. Combining these with order data and traffic/weather feeds allows continuous 
estimation of arrival times and detection of anomalies (e. g., deviations from route or temperature 
excursions).  
--- Page 3 ---
 
La Poste built such a system with Pathway; microservices ingest GPS events from Kafka, filter invalid data 
(e.g., (0,0) coordinates) and join the streams with historical routes to compute ETAs and send  alerts. 
Pathway’s connectors and streaming engine made it possible to decouple data preparation and 
prediction into separate microservices, scaling independently. Similar ETAs can be built for public 
transport, ride -sharing or shipping companies.  
2. Pred ictive Maintenance for Industrial Equipment  
Manufacturing facilities often deploy sensors that emit temperature, vibration and pressure readings. A 
real-time pipeline can ingest these readings via Kafka or MQTT, engineer features (e.g., rolling means, 
frequency spectrum), and feed them into ML models to predict failures and schedule maintenance.  
An example architecture described on Medium uses Kafka for ingestion, Flink for feature engineering, 
and a model server to estimate failure probability; a dashboa rd triggers alerts. Pathway can implement 
the same pattern with simplified code using its stateful streaming engine and built -in connectors, while 
the Document Store can index historical maintenance logs and technical manuals to answer 
maintenance -technici an queries.  
3. Asset Utilisation and Warehouse Automation  
IoT sensors on forklifts, pallets and robots produce continuous location and state data. By streaming 
these signals into Pathway and combining them with ERP and order management systems, companies  
can compute utilisation metrics, optimise routing of AGVs or robots, and detect bottlenecks.  
Real -time tracking improves transparency by allowing personnel to track products’ location and 
temperature in real time and to send alerts when shipments deviate  from the route. IoT enables storage 
monitoring (temperature, humidity), contingency planning (rerouting during traffic or weather 
disruptions) and accurate inventory control. These capabilities align with Pathway’s connectors (e.g., 
MQTT, OPC -UA, SQL) and  streaming analytics.  
4. Smart Warehouses and Robotics  
Automated guided vehicles (AGVs), robotic picking and packing systems and RFID -enabled inventory 
management produce high -frequency events. Real -time data streaming helps coordinate these 
subsystems. AGVs transport materials, robotic pickers fulfill orders and RFID sensors track stock levels. 
Pathway can ingest streams from AGVs, update the system state, compute optimal dispatch schedules, 
and interface with the Document Store to provide instructions o r troubleshooting steps.

4. Use -Case Themes in Financial Services  
1. Real -Time Market Analytics and Risk Management  
Streaming ETL is essential for processing tick -by-tick market data, computing option Greeks and other 
risk metrics. Pathway ingests h istorical and live CME market data and continuously computes Delta, 
Gamma, Theta, Vega and Rho using the Black -76 model. The pipeline updates values in real time, making 
it suitable for traders who need live exposures.  
2. Real -Time Fraud Detection  
Financ ial transactions arrive at high volume and require responses within milliseconds to ensure 
seamless user experience. Traditional rule -based fraud systems fail to detect complex patterns; AI -based 
models analysing vast data streams are more effective.  
A fraud-detection architecture commonly used publishes transactions to Kafka, consumes them with a 
specialized service integrated with a TensorFlow model, classifies transactions as fraudulent or 
legitimate, and logs them for auditing. Features such as transac tion amount and hour of day help flag 
suspicious patterns. Pathway can implement similar pipelines; its streaming engine offers exactly -once 
semantics, while the Document Store can hold regulatory policies, sanction lists and previous cases.  
3. Streaming Log Analysis and Anomaly Detection  
System logs are a treasure trove of operational information but are often analysed after incidents. A 
pipeline can analyse logs in real time, identify anomalies and alert administrators before problems 
escalate. Logs var y widely across applications, making schema -flexible streaming essential. Pathway can 
ingest log streams, apply natural -language models to classify log messages, detect anomalies or root 
causes, and use the Document Store to index runbooks and remediation guides.  
4. RAG -Driven Personal Finance Assistants  
A GenAI assistant for banking can combine streaming events (transactions, budget updates) with 
knowledge of financial products, compliance rules and customer documents. Using Pathway, one could 
stream account events, compute embeddings of transaction narra tives, store them in the Document 
Store, and integrate with an LLM to answer questions such as “How much did I spend on groceries this 
month?” or “Is there unusual activity on my account?” while maintaining compliance.  
5. Regulatory Compliance and Documen t Analysis  
Financial institutions must process large volumes of legal texts, policies and customer communications. 
Pathway’s connectors can ingest documents from SharePoint, Google Drive or file servers, index them in 
--- Page 5 ---
 
the Document Store, and continuously update the index when policies change. Combining this with 
streaming events allows compliance teams to ask an LLM: “Does this transaction violate the latest AML 
rule?” and obtain an answer with citations.

? Developer Resources and Technical Requirements  
To ensure your project demonstrates strong re al-time and production -readiness capabilities, all teams 
must adhere to the following requirements and leverage the official Pathway developer ecosystem. 
Exploit pathway to the max.  
  
 
1. Live Data Ingestion with Pathway Connectors  
Your system must utilize Pathway’s real -time connectors  to ingest streaming data relevant to your 
chosen use case.   
Pathway provides built -in connectors for files, databases, message queues, APIs, and web sources , all 
operating in streaming mode, ensuring results update in real time as data changes.   
If your desired data source is not directly supported, you must extend Pathway’s ingestion layer by 
implementing your own connector using the Custom Python Connector. This allows you to adapt 
Pathway to new sou rces and contributes to enhancing the engine’s capabilities.
